== !BootUnlocker for Nexus Devices -- Unlock your bootloader without fastboot. ==

This application *REQUIRES* a Galaxy Nexus (_maguro_, _toro_ or _toroplus_), Nexus 4 (_mako_),
Nexus 5 (_hammerhead_), Nexus 7 2013 (_deb_ or _flo_), Nexus 10 (_manta_),
!OnePlus One (_bacon_ / _A0001_), !OnePlus 2 (_OnePlus2_), !OnePlus X (_OnePlus_ / _ONE_ / _E1001_),
!YU Yuphoria (_lettuce_ / _YUPHORIA_), !YU Yureka (_tomato_ / _YUREKA_), !Lenovo Zuk Z1 (_ham_ / _Z1_),
!InFocus M810 (_VNA_), !InFocus M812 (_VN2_), or !Yota Phone 2 (_yotaphone2_), with root.

--------

_!BootUnlocker for Nexus Devices_ avoids using `fastboot oem unlock`, with its associated
`userdata` wipe. When fastboot unlocks it updates a lock status flag, stored on a partition
of your device's internal storage. Device partitions, positions and state values
(locked/unlocked) are as follows:

  * On the Galaxy Nexus, the bootloader uses position `0x000007C` of the "param" partition, stored as 01 / 00.
  * On the Nexus 10, the bootloader uses position `0x0000224` of the "param" partition, stored as 00 / 01.
  * On the Nexus 4 and Nexus 5, the bootloaders use position `0x0004010` of the "misc" partition, stored as 00 / 01. The Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 have a "Tamper" flag, at position `0x0004014` of the "misc" partition, stored as 00 / 01 (untampered/tampered).
  * On the Nexus 7 (2013), the bootloader uses position `0x04FFC00` of the "aboot" partition, stored as 00 / 02.
  * On the !OnePlus One, !OnePlus X, !YU Yuphoria, !YU Yureka, !InFocus M810, and !InFocus M812, the bootloaders use position `0x000FFE10` of the "aboot" partition, stored as 00 / 01. The OnePlus One, OnePlus X, YU Yuphoria, YU Yureka, InFocus M810, and InFocus M812 have a "Tamper" flag, at position `0x000FFE14` of the "aboot" partition, stored as 00 / 01 (untampered/tampered).
  * On the !OnePlus 2, the bootloader uses position `0x00000010` of the "devinfo" partition, stored as 00 / 01. The OnePlus 2 has a "Tamper" flag, at position `0x00000014` of the "devinfo" partition, stored as 00 / 01 (untampered/tampered).
  * On the !Lenovo Zuk Z1, the bootloader uses position `0x001FFE10` of the "aboot" partition, stored as 00 / 01. The Lenovo Zuk Z1 has a "Tamper" flag, at position `0x001FFE14` of the "aboot" partition, stored as 00 / 01 (untampered/tampered).
  * On the !Yota Phone 2, the bootloader uses position `0x004FFE10` of the "aboot" partition, stored as 00 / 01.


On devices with Tamper flag locations listed above, _!BootUnlocker for Nexus Devices_ can also
set and clear this flag. You can also view this flag using `fastboot oem device-info`.


_!BootUnlocker_ uses root privileges to write to to the appropriate location directly, bypassing fastboot.
This allows you to lock and unlock your bootloader from within Android, without wiping your `userdata` partition.

Special thanks go to those who posted raw images of their device partitions,
helped with/conducted the analysis, or put their devices in harm's way to beta test:
