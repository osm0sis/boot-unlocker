------------------------------------------------------------------------

You've rooted your device, and you are trying to decide between the
security of relocking your bootloader (with stock recovery and USB
Debugging off), and the flexibility of leaving it unlocked.

You know that in order to prevent an unauthorized user from accessing
your data by flashing a custom recovery, "`fastboot oem unlock`" wipes
your data. This also means that if you relock your bootloader, you will
need to do a full backup-and-restore whenever you decide to unlock it
again.

*BootUnlocker for Nexus Devices* lets you have the best of both
worlds by using root privileges to unlock your bootloader from within
Android, without wiping your data. This allows you to keep your
bootloader locked for security, with this application safely protected
behind your lockscreen password. Whenever you want to unlock or relock
your bootloader, just unlock your screen and run *BootUnlocker*.
